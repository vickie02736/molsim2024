Short helpfile for action MOLINFO
****************************************
The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  CHAIN - (for masochists ( mostly Davide Branduardi ) ) The atoms 
                          involved in each of the chains of interest in the structure.. For 
                          more information on how to specify lists of atoms see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

              STRUCTURE - a file in pdb format containing a reference structure. This 
                          is used to defines the atoms in the various residues, chains, 
                          etc . For more details on the PDB file format visit 
                          http://www.wwpdb.org/docs.html 
                MOLTYPE - ( default=protein ) what kind of molecule is contained in 
                          the pdb file
