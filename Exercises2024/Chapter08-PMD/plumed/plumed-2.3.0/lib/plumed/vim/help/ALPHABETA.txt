Short helpfile for action ALPHABETA
****************************************
The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - the atoms involved in each of the collective variables you 
                          wish to calculate. Keywords like ATOMS1, ATOMS2, ATOMS3,... 
                          should be listed and one CV will be calculated for each ATOM 
                          keyword you specify (all ATOM keywords should define the same 
                          number of atoms). The eventual number of quantities calculated by 
                          this action will depend on what functions of the distribution 
                          you choose to calculate. You can use multiple instances of this 
                          keyword i.e. ATOMS1, ATOMS2, ATOMS3... 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

              REFERENCE - the reference values for each of the torsional angles. If 
                          you use a single REFERENCE value the same reference value is 
                          used for all torsions You can use multiple instances of this 
                          keyword i.e. REFERENCE1, REFERENCE2, REFERENCE3... 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation
