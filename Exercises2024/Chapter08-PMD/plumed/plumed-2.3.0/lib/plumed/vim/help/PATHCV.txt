Short helpfile for action PATHCV
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

               PERIODIC - if the output of your function is periodic then you should 
                          specify the periodicity of the function. If the output is not 
                          periodic you must state this using PERIODIC=NO 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                    ARG - the input for this action is the scalar output from one or 
                          more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are 
                          referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its 
                          own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single 
                          scalar value. The value of this scalar is thus used as the input 
                          to this new action. If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated 
                          by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken. Some 
                          actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the 
                          output has a specific label. For example a \ref DISTANCE action 
                          labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z. To take just the 
                          x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all 
                          three components then use dist.*.More information on the 
                          referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the 
                          PLUMED \ref Syntax. Scalar values can also be referenced using 
                          POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref 
                          Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the 
                          appropriate flag. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          ARG1, ARG2, ARG3... 
                 INFILE - an input file from which an initial path is read 
                GENPATH - to generate an initial path as a linear interpolation 
                          between 2 fixed nodes, supply 3 integers for the number of head, 
                          middle, and tail nodes, followed by the positions of the two fixed 
                          nodes 
                  FIXED - the numbers of the two path nodes that remain fixed during 
                          a path optimization. If omitted, by default the first and 
                          last nodes are fixed 
                   PACE - the path update pace (default=0) 
                OUTFILE - an output file in which the path updates are stored 
                          (default=PATH) 
                 STRIDE - the frequency of writing the path to output file (default: 
                          equal to PACE) 
               HALFLIFE - the number of MD steps after which a previously measured 
                          path distance weighs only 50% in the average. This option may 
                          increase convergence by allowing to "forget" the memory of a bad 
                          initial guess path. A negative number sets it to infinity 
                          (=default) 
             WALKERS_ID - walker id 
              WALKERS_N - number of walkers 
            WALKERS_DIR - shared directory with the path files from all the walkers 
        WALKERS_RSTRIDE - stride for reading hills files
