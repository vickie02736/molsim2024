Short helpfile for action BRIDGE
****************************************
The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - the atoms involved in each of the collective variables you 
                          wish to calculate. Keywords like ATOMS1, ATOMS2, ATOMS3,... 
                          should be listed and one CV will be calculated for each ATOM 
                          keyword you specify (all ATOM keywords should define the same 
                          number of atoms). The eventual number of quantities calculated by 
                          this action will depend on what functions of the distribution 
                          you choose to calculate. You can use multiple instances of this 
                          keyword i.e. ATOMS1, ATOMS2, ATOMS3... 
         BRIDGING_ATOMS - The list of atoms that can form the bridge between the two 
                          interesting parts of the structure. 
                 GROUPA - The list of atoms that are in the first interesting part of 
                          the structure 
                 GROUPB - The list of atoms that are in the second interesting part 
                          of the structure 

The following options are available

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
                 SWITCH - The parameters of the two \ref switchingfunction in the 
                          above formula 
                SWITCHA - The \ref switchingfunction on the distance between bridging 
                          atoms and the atoms in group A 
                SWITCHB - The \ref switchingfunction on the distance between the 
                          bridging atoms and the atoms in group B
