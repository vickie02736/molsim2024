Short helpfile for action READ
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                 STRIDE - ( default=1 ) the frequency with which the file should be 
                          read. 
                  EVERY - ( default=1 ) only read every ith line of the colvar file. 
                          This should be used if the colvar was written more frequently 
                          than the trajectory. 
                 VALUES - the values to read from the file 
                   FILE - the name of the file from which to read these quantities 

In addition you may use the following options: 

            IGNORE_TIME - ( default=off ) ignore the time in the colvar file. When 
                          this flag is not present read will be quite strict about the 
                          start time of the simulation and the stride between frames 
          IGNORE_FORCES - ( default=off ) use this flag if the forces added by any 
                          bias can be safely ignored. As an example forces can be safely 
                          ignored if you are doing postprocessing that does not involve 
                          outputting forces 
            UPDATE_FROM - Only update this action from this time 
           UPDATE_UNTIL - Only update this action until this time
