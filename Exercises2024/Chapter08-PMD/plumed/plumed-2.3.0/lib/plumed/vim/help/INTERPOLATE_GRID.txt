Short helpfile for action INTERPOLATE_GRID
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                 STRIDE - ( default=1 ) the frequency with which the data should be 
                          collected and added to the quantity being averaged 
                  CLEAR - ( default=0 ) the frequency with which to clear all the 
                          accumulated data. The default value of 0 implies that all the data will 
                          be used and that the grid will never be cleared 
                   GRID - the action that creates the input grid you would like to 
                          use 

In addition you may use the following options: 

                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
            UNORMALIZED - ( default=off ) output the unaveraged quantity/quantities. 
             LOGWEIGHTS - list of actions that calculates log weights that should be 
                          used to weight configurations when calculating averages 
              COMPONENT - if your input is a vector field use this to specifiy the 
                          component of the input vector field for which you wish to use 
               GRID_BIN - the number of bins for the grid 
           GRID_SPACING - the approximate grid spacing (to be used as an alternative 
                          or together with GRID_BIN)
