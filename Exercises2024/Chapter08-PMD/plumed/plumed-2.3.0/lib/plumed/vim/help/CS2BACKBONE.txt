The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - The atoms to be included in the calculation, e.g. the whole 
                          protein.. For more information on how to specify lists of atoms see 
                          \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                   DATA - ( default=data/ ) The folder with the experimental chemical 
                          shifts. 
               TEMPLATE - ( default=template.pdb ) A PDB file of the protein system 
                          to initialise ALMOST. 
             NEIGH_FREQ - ( default=20 ) Period in step for neighbour list update. 
                   NRES - Number of residues, corresponding to the number of chemical 
                          shifts. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
               CAMSHIFT - ( default=off ) Set to TRUE if you to calculate a single 
                          CamShift score. 
                  NOEXP - ( default=off ) Set to TRUE if you don't want to have fixed 
                          components with the experimetnal values.
