****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                   DATA - The multicolvar that calculates the set of base quantities 
                          that we are interested in 
                  LOWER - the lower boundary for the range of interest 
                  UPPER - the upper boundary for the range of interest 
                  SMEAR - ( default=0.5 ) the ammount by which to smear the value for 
                          kernel density estimation 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
                   MEAN - take the mean of these variables. The final value can be 
                          referenced using <em>label</em>.mean. You can use multiple instances 
                          of this keyword i.e. MEAN1, MEAN2, MEAN3... The corresponding 
                          values are then referenced using <em>label</em>.mean-1, 
                          <em>label</em>.mean-2, <em>label</em>.mean-3... 
                MOMENTS - calculate the moments of the distribution of collective 
                          variables. 
                    MIN - calculate the minimum value. 
                    MAX - calculate the maximum value. 
                ALT_MIN - calculate the minimum value. 
                 LOWEST - this flag allows you to recover the lowest of these 
                          variables. The final value can be referenced using 
                          <em>label</em>.lowest 
                HIGHEST - this flag allows you to recover the highest of these 
                          variables. The final value can be referenced using 
                          <em>label</em>.highest 
                   BEAD - This keywords is used if you want to employ an alternative 
                          to the function defeind above. The following provides 
                          information on the \ref histogrambead that are available. When this 
                          keyword is present you no longer need the LOWER, UPPER and SMEAR 
                          keywords.
