The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                   ATOM - the atom whose vicinity we are interested in examining. For 
                          more information on how to specify lists of atoms see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                   DATA - The multicolvar that calculates the set of base quantities 
                          that we are interested in 
                 KERNEL - ( default=gaussian ) the type of kernel function to be used 
                 RADIUS - the switching function that tells us the extent of the 
                          sphereical region of interest 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
                OUTSIDE - ( default=off ) calculate quantities for colvars that are 
                          on atoms outside the region of interest 
                   MEAN - take the mean of these variables. The final value can be 
                          referenced using <em>label</em>.mean. You can use multiple instances 
                          of this keyword i.e. MEAN1, MEAN2, MEAN3... The corresponding 
                          values are then referenced using <em>label</em>.mean-1, 
                          <em>label</em>.mean-2, <em>label</em>.mean-3... 
              LESS_THAN - calculate the number of variables less than a certain 
                          target value. 
              MORE_THAN - calculate the number of variables more than a certain 
                          target value. 
                BETWEEN - calculate the number of values that are within a certain 
                          range. These quantities are calculated using kernel density 
                          estimation as described on \ref histogrambead. The final value can be 
                          referenced using <em>label</em>.between. You can use multiple 
                          instances of this keyword i.e. BETWEEN1, BETWEEN2, BETWEEN3... The 
                          corresponding values are then referenced using <em>label</em>.between-1, 
                          <em>label</em>.between-2, <em>label</em>.between-3... 
              HISTOGRAM - calculate a discretized histogram of the distribution of 
                          values. This shortcut allows you to calculates NBIN quantites like 
                          BETWEEN. The final value can be referenced using 
                          <em>label</em>.histogram. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          HISTOGRAM1, HISTOGRAM2, HISTOGRAM3... The corresponding values are then 
                          referenced using <em>label</em>.histogram-1, 
                          <em>label</em>.histogram-2, <em>label</em>.histogram-3...
