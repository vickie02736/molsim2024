Short helpfile for action FIND_CONTOUR_SURFACE
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                 STRIDE - ( default=1 ) the frequency with which the data should be 
                          collected and added to the quantity being averaged 
                  CLEAR - ( default=0 ) the frequency with which to clear all the 
                          accumulated data. The default value of 0 implies that all the data will 
                          be used and that the grid will never be cleared 
                   GRID - the action that creates the input grid you would like to 
                          use 
                CONTOUR - the value we would like to draw the contour at in the space 
              SEARCHDIR - In which directions do you wish to search for the contour. 
                 BUFFER - ( default=0 ) number of buffer grid points around location 
                          where grid was found on last step. If this is zero the full grid 
                          is calculated on each step 

In addition you may use the following options: 

                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
            UNORMALIZED - ( default=off ) output the unaveraged quantity/quantities. 
             LOGWEIGHTS - list of actions that calculates log weights that should be 
                          used to weight configurations when calculating averages 
              COMPONENT - if your input is a vector field use this to specifiy the 
                          component of the input vector field for which you wish to use
