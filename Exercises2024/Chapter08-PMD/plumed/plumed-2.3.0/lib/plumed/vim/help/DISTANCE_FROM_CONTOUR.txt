Short helpfile for action DISTANCE_FROM_CONTOUR
****************************************
The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                   ATOM - The atom whose perpendicular distance we are calculating 
                          from the contour. For more information on how to specify lists 
                          of atoms see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                   DATA - The input base multicolvar which is being used to calculate 
                          the contour 
              BANDWIDTH - the bandwidths for kernel density esimtation 
                 KERNEL - ( default=gaussian ) the kernel function you are using. 
                          More details on the kernels available in plumed plumed can be 
                          found in \ref kernelfunctions. 
                    DIR - the direction perpendicular to the contour that you are 
                          looking for 
                CONTOUR - the value we would like for the contour 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation
