Short helpfile for action MOVINGRESTRAINT
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                  VERSE - ( default=B ) Tells plumed whether the restraint is only 
                          acting for CV larger (U) or smaller (L) than the restraint or 
                          whether it is acting on both sides (B) 
                   STEP - This keyword appears multiple times as STEPx with 
                          x=0,1,2,...,n. Each value given represents the MD step at which the 
                          restraint parameters take the values KAPPAx and ATx. You can use 
                          multiple instances of this keyword i.e. STEP1, STEP2, STEP3... 
                     AT - ATx is equal to the position of the restraint at time 
                          STEPx. For intermediate times this parameter is linearly 
                          interpolated. If no ATx is specified for STEPx then the values of AT are 
                          kept constant during the interval of time between STEPx-1 and 
                          STEPx. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. AT1, 
                          AT2, AT3... 
                  KAPPA - KAPPAx is equal to the value of the force constants at time 
                          STEPx. For intermediate times this parameter is linearly 
                          interpolated. If no KAPPAx is specified for STEPx then the values of 
                          KAPPAx are kept constant during the interval of time between 
                          STEPx-1 and STEPx. You can use multiple instances of this keyword 
                          i.e. KAPPA1, KAPPA2, KAPPA3... 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                    ARG - the input for this action is the scalar output from one or 
                          more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are 
                          referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its 
                          own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single 
                          scalar value. The value of this scalar is thus used as the input 
                          to this new action. If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated 
                          by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken. Some 
                          actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the 
                          output has a specific label. For example a \ref DISTANCE action 
                          labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z. To take just the 
                          x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all 
                          three components then use dist.*.More information on the 
                          referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the 
                          PLUMED \ref Syntax. Scalar values can also be referenced using 
                          POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref 
                          Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the 
                          appropriate flag. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          ARG1, ARG2, ARG3...
