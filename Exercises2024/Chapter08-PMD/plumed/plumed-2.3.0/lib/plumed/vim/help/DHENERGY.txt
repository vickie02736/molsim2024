The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                 GROUPA - First list of atoms. For more information on how to specify 
                          lists of atoms see \ref Group 
                 GROUPB - Second list of atoms (if empty, N*(N-1)/2 pairs in GROUPA 
                          are counted). For more information on how to specify lists of 
                          atoms see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                      I - ( default=1.0 ) Ionic strength (M) 
                   TEMP - ( default=300.0 ) Simulation temperature (K) 
                EPSILON - ( default=80.0 ) Dielectric constant of solvent 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) Perform the calculation in serial - for 
                          debug purpose 
                   PAIR - ( default=off ) Pair only 1st element of the 1st group with 
                          1st element in the second, etc 
                  NLIST - ( default=off ) Use a neighbour list to speed up the 
                          calculation 
              NL_CUTOFF - The cutoff for the neighbour list 
              NL_STRIDE - The frequency with which we are updating the atoms in the 
                          neighbour list
