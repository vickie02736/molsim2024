****************************************
The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                 GROUPA - First list of atoms. For more information on how to specify 
                          lists of atoms see \ref Group 
                 GROUPB - Second list of atoms (if empty, N*(N-1)/2 pairs in GROUPA 
                          are counted). For more information on how to specify lists of 
                          atoms see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                     NN - ( default=6 ) The n parameter of the switching function 
                     MM - ( default=0 ) The m parameter of the switching function; 0 
                          implies 2*NN 
                    D_0 - ( default=0.0 ) The d_0 parameter of the switching function 
                    R_0 - The r_0 parameter of the switching function 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) Perform the calculation in serial - for 
                          debug purpose 
                   PAIR - ( default=off ) Pair only 1st element of the 1st group with 
                          1st element in the second, etc 
                  NLIST - ( default=off ) Use a neighbour list to speed up the 
                          calculation 
              NL_CUTOFF - The cutoff for the neighbour list 
              NL_STRIDE - The frequency with which we are updating the atoms in the 
                          neighbour list 
                 SWITCH - This keyword is used if you want to employ an alternative 
                          to the continuous swiching function defined above. The 
                          following provides information on the \ref switchingfunction that are 
                          available. When this keyword is present you no longer need the NN, MM, 
                          D_0 and R_0 keywords.
