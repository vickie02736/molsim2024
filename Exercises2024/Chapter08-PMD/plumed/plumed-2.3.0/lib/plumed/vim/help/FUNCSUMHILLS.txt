The following options are available

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
               ISCLTOOL - ( default=on ) use via plumed commandline: calculate at 
                          read phase and then go 
           PARALLELREAD - ( default=off ) read parallel HILLS file 
                NEGBIAS - ( default=off ) dump negative bias ( -bias ) instead of the 
                          free energy: needed in welltempered with flexible hills 
              NOHISTORY - ( default=off ) to be used with INITSTRIDE: it splits the 
                          bias/histogram in pieces without previous history 
              MINTOZERO - ( default=off ) translate the resulting bias/histogram to 
                          have the minimum to zero 
                    ARG - the input for this action is the scalar output from one or 
                          more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are 
                          referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its 
                          own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single 
                          scalar value. The value of this scalar is thus used as the input 
                          to this new action. If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated 
                          by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken. Some 
                          actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the 
                          output has a specific label. For example a \ref DISTANCE action 
                          labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z. To take just the 
                          x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all 
                          three components then use dist.*.More information on the 
                          referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the 
                          PLUMED \ref Syntax. Scalar values can also be referenced using 
                          POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref 
                          Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the 
                          appropriate flag. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          ARG1, ARG2, ARG3... 
             HILLSFILES - source file for hills creation(may be the same as HILLS) 
             HISTOFILES - source file for histogram creation(may be the same as 
                          HILLS) 
             HISTOSIGMA - sigmas for binning when the histogram correction is needed 
                   PROJ - only with sumhills: the projection on the cvs 
                     KT - only with sumhills: the kt factor when projection on cvs 
               GRID_MIN - the lower bounds for the grid 
               GRID_MAX - the upper bounds for the grid 
               GRID_BIN - the number of bins for the grid 
           GRID_SPACING - the approximate grid spacing (to be used as an alternative 
                          or together with GRID_BIN) 
               INTERVAL - set monodimensional INTERVAL 
               OUTHILLS - output file for hills 
               OUTHISTO - output file for histogram 
             INITSTRIDE - stride if you want an initial dump 
                 STRIDE - stride when you do it on the fly 
                    FMT - the format that should be used to output real numbers
