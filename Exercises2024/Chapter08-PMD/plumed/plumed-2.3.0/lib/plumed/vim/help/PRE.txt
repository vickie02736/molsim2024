The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

              SPINLABEL - The atom to be used as the paramagnetic center.. For more 
                          information on how to specify lists of atoms see \ref Group 
                 GROUPA - the atoms involved in each of the contacts you wish to 
                          calculate. Keywords like GROUPA1, GROUPA2, GROUPA3,... should be 
                          listed and one contact will be calculated for each ATOM keyword 
                          you specify. You can use multiple instances of this keyword 
                          i.e. GROUPA1, GROUPA2, GROUPA3... 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                  INEPT - is the INEPT time (in ms). 
                   TAUC - is the correlation time (in ns) for this electron-nuclear 
                          interaction. 
                  OMEGA - is the Larmor frequency of the nuclear spin (in MHz). 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 ADDEXP - ( default=off ) Set to TRUE if you want to have fixed 
                          components with the experimetnal values. 
                   RTWO - The relaxation of the atom/atoms in the corresponding 
                          GROUPA of atoms. Keywords like RTWO1, RTWO2, RTWO3,... should be 
                          listed. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. RTWO1, 
                          RTWO2, RTWO3... 
                 PREINT - Add an experimental value for each PRE. You can use 
                          multiple instances of this keyword i.e. PREINT1, PREINT2, PREINT3...
