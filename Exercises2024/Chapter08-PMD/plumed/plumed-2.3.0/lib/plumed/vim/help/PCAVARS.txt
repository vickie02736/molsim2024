The following arguments are compulsory: 

              REFERENCE - a pdb file containing the reference configuration and 
                          configurations that define the directions for each eigenvector 
                   TYPE - ( default=OPTIMAL ) The method we are using for alignment 
                          to the reference structure 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
              NORMALIZE - ( default=off ) calculate the length of the eigenvector 
                          input and divide the components by it so as to have a normalised 
                          vector
