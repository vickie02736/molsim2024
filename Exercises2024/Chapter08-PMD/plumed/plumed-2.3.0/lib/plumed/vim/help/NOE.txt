The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                 GROUPA - the atoms involved in each of the contacts you wish to 
                          calculate. Keywords like GROUPA1, GROUPA2, GROUPA3,... should be 
                          listed and one contact will be calculated for each ATOM keyword 
                          you specify. You can use multiple instances of this keyword 
                          i.e. GROUPA1, GROUPA2, GROUPA3... 
                 GROUPB - the atoms involved in each of the contacts you wish to 
                          calculate. Keywords like GROUPB1, GROUPB2, GROUPB3,... should be 
                          listed and one contact will be calculated for each ATOM keyword 
                          you specify. You can use multiple instances of this keyword 
                          i.e. GROUPB1, GROUPB2, GROUPB3... 

The following options are available

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 ADDEXP - ( default=off ) Set to TRUE if you want to have fixed 
                          components with the experimental reference values. 
                NOEDIST - Add an experimental value for each NOE. You can use 
                          multiple instances of this keyword i.e. NOEDIST1, NOEDIST2, 
                          NOEDIST3...
