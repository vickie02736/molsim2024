Short helpfile for action PCA
****************************************
The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - the atoms whose positions we are tracking for the purpose 
                          of analysing the data. For more information on how to specify 
                          lists of atoms see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                 STRIDE - ( default=1 ) the frequency with which the data should be 
                          collected and added to the quantity being averaged 
                  CLEAR - ( default=0 ) the frequency with which to clear all the 
                          accumulated data. The default value of 0 implies that all the data will 
                          be used and that the grid will never be cleared 
                 METRIC - ( default=EUCLIDEAN ) how are we measuring the distances 
                          between configurations 
                    RUN - ( default=0 ) the frequency with which to run the analysis 
                          algorithm. The default value of zero assumes you want to analyse the 
                          whole trajectory 
               NLOW_DIM - number of PCA coordinates required 
                  OFILE - the file on which to output the eigenvectors 

In addition you may use the following options: 

                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
            UNORMALIZED - ( default=off ) output the unaveraged quantity/quantities. 
       WRITE_CHECKPOINT - ( default=off ) write out a checkpoint so that the analysis 
                          can be restarted in a later run 
             LOGWEIGHTS - list of actions that calculates log weights that should be 
                          used to weight configurations when calculating averages 
                    ARG - the input for this action is the scalar output from one or 
                          more other actions. The particular scalars that you will use are 
                          referenced using the label of the action. If the label appears on its 
                          own then it is assumed that the Action calculates a single 
                          scalar value. The value of this scalar is thus used as the input 
                          to this new action. If * or *.* appears the scalars calculated 
                          by all the proceding actions in the input file are taken. Some 
                          actions have multi-component outputs and each component of the 
                          output has a specific label. For example a \ref DISTANCE action 
                          labelled dist may have three componets x, y and z. To take just the 
                          x component you should use dist.x, if you wish to take all 
                          three components then use dist.*.More information on the 
                          referencing of Actions can be found in the section of the manual on the 
                          PLUMED \ref Syntax. Scalar values can also be referenced using 
                          POSIX regular expressions as detailed in the section on \ref 
                          Regex. To use this feature you you must compile PLUMED with the 
                          appropriate flag. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          ARG1, ARG2, ARG3... 
                    FMT - the format that should be used in analysis output files 
                RESTART - allows per-action setting of restart (YES/NO/AUTO) 
            UPDATE_FROM - Only update this action from this time 
           UPDATE_UNTIL - Only update this action until this time
