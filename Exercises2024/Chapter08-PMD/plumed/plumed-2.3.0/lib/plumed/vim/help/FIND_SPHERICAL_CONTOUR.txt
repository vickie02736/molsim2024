Short helpfile for action FIND_SPHERICAL_CONTOUR
****************************************

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                 STRIDE - ( default=1 ) the frequency with which the data should be 
                          collected and added to the quantity being averaged 
                   GRID - the action that creates the input grid you would like to 
                          use 
                CONTOUR - the value we would like to draw the contour at in the space 
                   FILE - file on which to output coordinates 
                  UNITS - ( default=PLUMED ) the units in which to print out the 
                          coordinates. PLUMED means internal PLUMED units 
                NPOINTS - the number of points for which we are looking for the 
                          contour 
           INNER_RADIUS - the minimum radius on which to look for the contour 
           OUTER_RADIUS - the outer radius on which to look for the contour 
                  NBINS - ( default=1 ) the number of discrete sections in which to 
                          divide the distance between the inner and outer radius when 
                          searching for a contour 

In addition you may use the following options: 

                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
            UNORMALIZED - ( default=off ) output the unaveraged quantity/quantities. 
             LOGWEIGHTS - list of actions that calculates log weights that should be 
                          used to weight configurations when calculating averages 
              COMPONENT - if your input is a vector field use this to specifiy the 
                          component of the input vector field for which you wish to use 
              PRECISION - The number of digits in trajectory file
