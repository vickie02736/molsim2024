The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - the list of atoms (use @lcs-nn). For more information on 
                          how to specify lists of atoms see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

              REFERENCE - a file in pdb format containing the reference structure and 
                          the atoms involved in the CV. 
                 CUTOFF - ( default=2.4 ) only pairs of atoms closer than CUTOFF are 
                          considered in the calculation. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                  PAIRS - List of pairs considered. All pairs are considered if this 
                          value is not specified.
