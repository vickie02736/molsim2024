Short helpfile for action RDC
****************************************
The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - the couple of atoms involved in each of the bonds for which 
                          you wish to calculate the RDC. Keywords like ATOMS1, ATOMS2, 
                          ATOMS3,... should be listed and one dipolar coupling will be 
                          calculated for each ATOMS keyword you specify. You can use multiple 
                          instances of this keyword i.e. ATOMS1, ATOMS2, ATOMS3... 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                  GYROM - Add the product of the gyromagnetic constants for the bond. 
                  SCALE - Add the scaling factor to take into account concentration 
                          and other effects. 

In addition you may use the following options: 

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                    SVD - ( default=off ) Set to TRUE if you want to backcalculate 
                          using Single Value Decomposition (need GSL at compilation time). 
           ADDCOUPLINGS - ( default=off ) Set to TRUE if you want to have fixed 
                          components with the experimetnal values. 
               COUPLING - Add an experimental value for each coupling (needed by SVD 
                          and usefull for ef STATS). You can use multiple instances of 
                          this keyword i.e. COUPLING1, COUPLING2, COUPLING3...
