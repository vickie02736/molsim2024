Short helpfile for action TORSIONS

The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                  ATOMS - the atoms involved in each of the collective variables you 
                          wish to calculate. Keywords like ATOMS1, ATOMS2, ATOMS3,... 
                          should be listed and one CV will be calculated for each ATOM 
                          keyword you specify (all ATOM keywords should define the same 
                          number of atoms). The eventual number of quantities calculated by 
                          this action will depend on what functions of the distribution 
                          you choose to calculate. You can use multiple instances of this 
                          keyword i.e. ATOMS1, ATOMS2, ATOMS3... 

The following options are available

  NUMERICAL_DERIVATIVES - ( default=off ) calculate the derivatives for these 
                          quantities numerically 
                  NOPBC - ( default=off ) ignore the periodic boundary conditions 
                          when calculating distances 
                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
                BETWEEN - calculate the number of values that are within a certain 
                          range. These quantities are calculated using kernel density 
                          estimation as described on \ref histogrambead. The final value can be 
                          referenced using <em>label</em>.between. You can use multiple 
                          instances of this keyword i.e. BETWEEN1, BETWEEN2, BETWEEN3... The 
                          corresponding values are then referenced using <em>label</em>.between-1, 
                          <em>label</em>.between-2, <em>label</em>.between-3... 
              HISTOGRAM - calculate a discretized histogram of the distribution of 
                          values. This shortcut allows you to calculates NBIN quantites like 
                          BETWEEN. The final value can be referenced using 
                          <em>label</em>.histogram. You can use multiple instances of this keyword i.e. 
                          HISTOGRAM1, HISTOGRAM2, HISTOGRAM3... The corresponding values are then 
                          referenced using <em>label</em>.histogram-1, 
                          <em>label</em>.histogram-2, <em>label</em>.histogram-3...
