The input trajectory can be in any of the following formats: 

                 ORIGIN - we will use the position of this atom as the origin. For 
                          more information on how to specify lists of atoms see \ref Group 

The following arguments are compulsory: 

                 STRIDE - ( default=1 ) the frequency with which the data should be 
                          collected and added to the quantity being averaged 
                  CLEAR - ( default=0 ) the frequency with which to clear all the 
                          accumulated data. The default value of 0 implies that all the data will 
                          be used and that the grid will never be cleared 
              BANDWIDTH - the bandwidths for kernel density esimtation 
                 KERNEL - ( default=gaussian ) the kernel function you are using. 
                          More details on the kernels available in plumed plumed can be 
                          found in \ref kernelfunctions. 
                   DATA - the multicolvar which you would like to calculate the 
                          density profile for 
                    DIR - the direction in which to calculate the density profile 

In addition you may use the following options: 

                 SERIAL - ( default=off ) do the calculation in serial. Do not 
                          parallelize 
                 LOWMEM - ( default=off ) lower the memory requirements 
                TIMINGS - ( default=off ) output information on the timings of the 
                          various parts of the calculation 
            UNORMALIZED - ( default=off ) output the unaveraged quantity/quantities. 
             FRACTIONAL - ( default=off ) use fractional coordinates for the various 
                          axes 
               XREDUCED - ( default=off ) limit the calculation of the 
                          density/average to a portion of the z-axis only 
               YREDUCED - ( default=off ) limit the calculation of the 
                          density/average to a portion of the y-axis only 
               ZREDUCED - ( default=off ) limit the calculation of the 
                          density/average to a portion of the z-axis only 
             LOGWEIGHTS - list of actions that calculates log weights that should be 
                          used to weight configurations when calculating averages 
                  NBINS - the number of bins to use to represent the density profile 
                SPACING - the approximate grid spacing (to be used as an alternative 
                          or together with NBINS) 
                 XLOWER - this is required if you are using XREDUCED. It specifes the 
                          lower bound for the region of the x-axis that for which you are 
                          calculating the density/average 
                 XUPPER - this is required if you are using XREDUCED. It specifes the 
                          upper bound for the region of the x-axis that for which you are 
                          calculating the density/average 
                 YLOWER - this is required if you are using YREDUCED. It specifes the 
                          lower bound for the region of the y-axis that for which you are 
                          calculating the density/average 
                 YUPPER - this is required if you are using YREDUCED. It specifes the 
                          upper bound for the region of the y-axis that for which you are 
                          calculating the density/average 
                 ZLOWER - this is required if you are using ZREDUCED. It specifes the 
                          lower bound for the region of the z-axis that for which you are 
                          calculating the density/average 
                 ZUPPER - this is required if you are using ZREDUCED. It specifes the 
                          upper bound for the region of the z-axis that for which you are 
                          calculating the density/average
